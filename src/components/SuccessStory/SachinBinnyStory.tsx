        From IIT Dreams to Building an Empire: The Inspiring Journey of Sachin and Binny Bansal</h1>
      <span className="block text-center font-semibold mb-8">
            Every great success story begins with a dream, a spark of inspiration, and the
            courage to take the first step. The journey of Sachin and Binny Bansal, the
            visionary founders of Flipkart, is no different. Their story is a testament to the
            power of perseverance, innovation, and an unwavering belief in one's vision.
            Much like Alakh Pandey, who revolutionized education in India, the Bansals
            transformed the way India shops online.

      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
       <span> 
            Sachin and Binny, both graduates of the prestigious Indian Institute of
            Technology (IIT), shared more than just an alma mater—they shared a dream to
            create something extraordinary. While working at <b>Amazon</b>, they observed the
            untapped potential of e-commerce in India. They realized that while the world
            was moving online, India lacked a platform that truly understood the unique
            needs of its consumers. <br /> <br />
       </span>
       <span> 
            This realization sparked an idea—a platform that would not only bring
            convenience to Indian shoppers but also redefine the way people perceive online
            shopping. And so, <b>the seeds of Flipkart</b> were sown.

      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
        <p> 
            In 2007, with a modest investment and a bold vision, Sachin and Binny founded
            Flipkart from a small apartment in Bangalore. They started small, selling
            books—a category they believed had immense potential. Their mission was
            simple yet powerful: to create a reliable, customer-centric online shopping
            experience that would win the trust of Indian consumers.
            But the road to success was far from easy.
